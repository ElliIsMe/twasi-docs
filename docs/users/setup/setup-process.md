## Why do i have to Setup my Account?

We try to make everything and every bit of Twasi as easy and accessible as possible.  
To provide such, we collect data like your Avatar, your Twitch Banner and some additional Data throughout your first Visit of the Page.  
In the Setup Process we collect Data about your personal preferences like i.e. what plugins you wish to install.

## How does the Setup Process work?

### First Step

The First Step in the Setup after you authorized Twasi is the Page where you enter your personal Closed Beta Key to gain access to the Twasi Panel.  
Here you have to have accept our Terms of Condition in order to proceed the Setup process.

### Second Step

In the Second Stage of the Setup you can choose from a List of Plugins to install for your personal preferences.  
You can install and uninstall the plugins at any point of time via the Twasi Panel later on.
