## Seriously. Who wants to work with a bad looking Site?

Especially when you possibly see it everytime you stream.  
But as we all know taste is different so we decided to have a bunch of cool looking themes to choose from.  

### Where can i choose a theme?

If you have read the previous Page of this Documentation you should know that you can find the themeswitch button in the header section of the panel. Its Icon looks like a little color pallette.  
If you click on it you will be prompted with a Dialog that looks just like that:

![Themes](/img/userdocs/twasi-panel/themes/themeswitcher.png)

As you can see you can also Use your Twitch Banner as the background of the Header Section of your Twasi Panel.  

Yes. There is a Windows 95 Theme. •ᴗ•
