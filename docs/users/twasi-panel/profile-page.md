We will work on the Profile Page during the Closed Beta of Twasi.

## Sections of the Profile Page

The Profile Page consists of a variety of different cards with different functions.

### Your Twasi Data

In the "*Your Twasi Data*" Card you will find general informations about your Twasi and Twitch Account.  
From there on you can also delete your whole Twasi Account.

### Social Media

The "*Social Media*" Section is used to connect your social Media accounts to Twasi.  
Developers can then use functions of the connected Accounts to implement new Features to their Plugins.
